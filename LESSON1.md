## Lesson 1 - Writing your own shell script

_Please clone this repo and go into the lesson-1 folder in your terminal. The relevant files for this lesson are there._

### Introduction

It's important to realise that, in giving you access to the file system and network,
node can be used for more than just creating web servers. In this series of lessons we are going to use some of node's features to do some shell scripting!

A shell script is a program designed to be run by the Unix shell. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.

You've likely come across some typical shell commands already. Have you used `cat`, `ls`, or `grep` in your terminal before? To start off today, you're going to implement your own version of the `cat` command using javascript.

From your terminal if you want to execute a javascript program you've written you can use the following command:

```
node path_to_program.js
```

Note the path you give to the program is relative to what directory you are in.

Something you may not know is that you can actually pass arguments into your javascript program from the command line as well. For example:

```
node path_to_program.js node is awesome
```

All arguments (in this case `'node'`, `'is'`, and `'awesome'`, separated by spaces) will be passed into your program as strings and can be accessed inside it using an object called `process` that is in-built with node.

`process` has a property called `argv`. It is an array. `process.argv[0]` is always the path to node on your machine, and `process.argv[1]` is always the path to the executed javascript file.

In this case `process.argv` will be:

```javscript
process.argv // = [path_to_node, path_to_current_file, 'node', 'is', 'awesome'];

//so you can access the arguments you pass in like so:

process.argv[2] // = 'node';
process.argv[3] // = 'is';
process.argv[4] // = 'awesome';

```

This is useful as it means we can pass into our programs the names of, or paths to, files, to be manipulated within the node program.

`process` has other useful methods. One in particular is `process.stdout.write()`. It is very similar to `console.log()` in that it will take what you input it and output it to the terminal. It has subtle differences, try experimenting with both in this exercise.

In this case if we use `node path_to_file.js node is awesome` to call `path_to_file.js` and inside the program write:

```
process.stdout.write(process.argv[2] + process.argv[3] + process.argv[4]);
```

It will output `node is awesome` to the terminal.

### Task 1a - cat command

In unix, `cat` is a command that takes the path to a file as its argument and will output the contents of that file to the terminal. It is used like this:

`cat path_to_file.extension`

Try outputting the contents of `index.html` in the public folder of this repo to the terminal to see what it looks like.

Inside `cat.js` write a program that when called like this from the terminal

`node path_to_cat.js path_to_file.extension`

will output the contents of that latter file to the terminal like `cat`.

*Hint: You will need the `process` object and the `fs` module.*

### Task 1b - options

Many unix commands have what are called options. Options are arguments you can pass to the execution of the command that modify its behaviour. They are typically in the format of a dash followed by a lowercase letter.

For example, `cat -n` will print not only the file itself to the terminal, but also the corresponding line numbers.

Your task is to modify your existing cat command in cat.js so that it can accept an option argument. If `-n` is passed as first argument (`node path_to_cat.js -n`), your cat command should print the corresponding line numbers to the terminal, in addition to the file itself. Your program should do its normal behaviour if no arguments are provided.

## Lesson 2 - Making your script executable

So that was fun! But wouldn't it be nice if rather than having to type

`node script.js arguments`

and adjusting the script's file path all the time relative to our current location, we could just run `script` in our terminal anywhere in our directory tree and know it will work just like existing shell commands?

You can do that in node and it only takes a few simple steps!

1: In your cat.js file, add this to the top line of the file:

```
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

2: Run `npm init` in the root folder of this repo and create a `package.json`.

3: Adjust your `package.json` as follows:

* remove the main entry: this is only used for modules that will be used through the module system (e.g. var _ = require('underscore');).
* add preferGlobal and set it to true, which means if someone installs this module through npm and doesnâ€™t use the --global option, they will be warned that the module is designed to be installed globally.
* add the bin object, which maps commands to files. This means when this module is installed, npm will set up the named executables to execute their assigned javascript files. Don't name them after existing commands like ls, grep, etc, it needs to be unique.

Your `package.json` should now look like this:

```javascript
{
  "name": "node-shell-workshop",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "learn how to shell script with node",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "your lovely selves",
  "license": "ISC",
  "preferGlobal": true,
  "bin": {
    "your-name-here-cat": "lesson-1/cat.js",
  }
}
```

4: Now in the same repo you can run `npm link` to install the script on your system. This creates a symlink to your project so that you can run the project whilst working on it, with no need to keep reinstalling it over and over again.

5: Now... move into a different directory and try out...

```
your-name-here-cat file.extension
```

## Lesson 3 - Using streams in your script

_Please go into the lesson-3 folder in your terminal. The relevant files for this lesson are there._

### Introduction

In this lesson we are going to cover an alternative way of reading and writing to files
using one of the core features of node: `streams`.

Whenever you've watched a video online, have you noticed you can start watching it
even though the whole video hasn't finished loading? That's because it is being 'streamed', bit by bit, so that as every chunk of its data becomes available it is immediately put to use.

A `stream` in node is simply an interface for working with 'streaming data' like this.
Streams can be `readable` (e.g. reading a file), `writable` (e.g. writing new content to a
file), or both.

### Streams in readFile

Let's start with something familiar. Up until now, whenever you've needed to read a file using node's `fs` module you've likely
done something like the following:

```javascript
fs.readFile(file, function(err, file) {
  if (err) console.error(err);
  // do something with file
});
```

It turns out that under the hood, `readFile` actually uses streams! Let's look at a simplified version of the `readFile` function:

```javascript
fs.readFile = function(file, cb) {

  var readStream = fs.createReadStream(file);
  //set up a read stream on a target file and store it in a variable

  var fileContent = '';
  //create an empty string we will use to store the contents of the read file.

  readStream.on('data', function(chunk) {
    fileContent += chunk;
  });
  //every time a new chunk of the read file becomes available we append it to our fileContent variable

  readStream.on('error', function(err) {
    cb(err, fileContent)
  });
  // handle errors

  readStream.on('end', function() {
    cb(null, fileContent);
  });
  // do something with fileContent
}
```

Now let's go through each bit in more detail, and explain what's happening.

`streams` have a method `stream.on('event', function () {})`. What it does is subscribes a function to the specified event, so that it will be executed every time the event occurs.

```
readStream.on('data', function (chunk) {
  fileContent += chunk;
});
```

Here `data` is the type of event. The target file of `readStream` will be read bit by bit. Every time a new chunk becomes available, the `data` event is triggered and the function is called. Its first argument is always
the contents of the new available `chunk`.

Here we just append each chunk of new content to the `fileContent` variable as soon
as it becomes available. Finally, when the stream has finished reading the file the `end` event is triggered.
At this point, the whole file has been read chunk by chunk, and the variable `fileContent`
should contain all the content of the read file.

### Task 3a - Read Streams

Inside `cat.js` re-write your `cat` command to use a read stream instead of `fs.readFile`.

To recap, your `cat` command should be executed like this:

`node cat.js file.extension`

It should output the contents of `file.extension` to the terminal. You can try using
your command on some example files in the public folder.

*Hint: If you see something like this get outputted to your terminal:*

```
<Buffer 68 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64>
```

*This is called a 'buffer'. It's an encoded format that represents the file's raw
binary data. Each part of the sequence `68`, `65`, `6c` etc, represent characters
of the file that is being read. `10` for example is equivalent to `/n`. To convert
the buffer into a string you can use the `toString()` method, or provide `'utf-8'` as the
second argument of `fs.createReadStream`.*

### Task 3b - Write Streams

If read streams let you read files, write streams let you write content to them!

Create a new file now called `write-stream.js` and try out the following. Type it rather than copy and paste:

```javascript
var fs = require("fs");
var data = 'Simply Easy Learning';

// Create a writable stream
var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

// Write the data to stream with encoding to be utf8
writeStream.write(data,'UTF8');

// Mark the end of file
writeStream.end();

// When the stream finishes log 'write completed'
writeStream.on('finish', function() {
    console.log("Write completed.");
});
```

Now try running `node write-stream.js`. It should log `Write completed.` to the terminal and a new file called `output.txt` with the content `Simply Easy Learning` should have been created.

Did you notice write streams use `.write()` and `.end()` like the `response` object of your servers? That's because the `response` object is a write stream and when you're responding to the client you're 'writing' content to it!

The `request` object, likewise, is a read stream as when the client makes a request you're 'reading' the content that has been 'streamed' to the server!

### Task 3c - Redirection

In Unix, it is possible to take the output of a command that would normally be printed
to the terminal (standard output) and redirect it so that the contents of that output
are written to a file instead.

The command we use to accomplish this is `>` :

```
cat index.html > example.js
```

`cat index.html` will read the html file and output its contents, then `>` will take
this output and redirect it so that it is written to `example.js` instead.

Go into the public folder and try this:

```
node path_to_your_cat.js index.html > example.js
```

Can you see `example.js` now has been overwritten to contain the contents of `index.html`?

*(note: this command will over-write the file's prior content so be careful using this on your
solution scripts.)*

Inside `write.js` modify your `cat` command from the first exercise so that you can
give it the following arguments

```
node write.js read.extension '>' write.extension
```

If `'>'` is given as argument followed by another file as an argument it will,
instead of outputting the contents of `read.extension` to the terminal, write the contents
of it to `write.extension` instead.

*Hint: To write content to `write.extension` you will need to create a write stream like so:*

```javascript
var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(write.extension)
```

*If you want to take the output of a read stream and make it become the input
of a write stream, this is called 'piping.' Piping in node is done using `streams`
`pipe()` method:*

```javascript
var readStream = fs.createReadStream(read.extension);
var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(write.extension);

readStream.pipe(writeStream);
```
*What this code snippet means is every time a new `chunk` of `read.extension` gets read by
`readStream` it will immediately be redirected to become the input of `writeStream`. This input
will get written to `write.extension`.*

### Task 3d - Appending files

You may not always want to completely re-write the contents of a file. What if
you want the content of a file to remain intact but simply append new content
onto the end of it?

In Unix you can do this using `>>` :

```
cat index.html >> example.js
```

`cat index.html` will read the html file and output its contents, then `>>` will take
this output and redirect it so that it is appended to the contents of `example.js`.

Go into the public folder and try this:

```
node path_to_your_cat.js index.html >> example.js
```

Can you see `example.js` now has the contents of `index.html` appended onto the end?

Inside `append.js` modify your `cat` command from the first exercise so that you can
give it the following arguments

```
node append.js read.extension '>>' write.extension
```

If `'>>'` is provided as an argument followed by a file as another argument it will,
instead of outputting the contents of `read.extension` to the terminal, append
it to `write.extension` instead.

*Hint: There are multiple ways of solving this. `fs.createReadStream`, and `fs.createWriteStream`
can be passed a flags object as a second argument. In particular:*

```javascript
var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(write.extension, { 'flags': 'a' })
```

*allows write streams to append instead of write content.*
